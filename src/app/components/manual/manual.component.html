    <ul>
        <li>The first step is the AUTO IDENTIFY button. This function identifies all texts in the HTML template that may need to be translated.</li>
        <li>The identified HTML view elements will now have blue borders</li>
        <li>Once you've identified the elements and the blue borders appear, save the template. To do this, press the blue SAVE TEMPLATE button in the lower bar, left side</li>
        <li>Move the mouse and click on an element to select it. Information about its identifier will appear on the left side. The selected item will be highlighted in orange.</li>
        <li>To start adding translations, select the language you are translating into. To do this, press the blue button to: in the bottom bar, in the LANGUAGES section and select the language. The selected language should appear next to the button</li>
        <li>After selecting an element, its original content should appear in the window in the section on the left. The translation of this content should be entered in the empty window below.</li>
        <li>If the element has been translated sooner, the translation window will contain this translation. They can be freely changed.</li>
        <li>Some elements are divided into several texts if they are separated, for example, by a newline symbol. In this case, there will be several original text and translation windows. The appropriate proportions between the text fragments should be kept.</li>
        <li>To enter the translation of an element into the system, complete all translation windows, if there are several of them, and press the green ADD TRANSLATION button or the ENTER key on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>After successfully entering the translation, an appropriate message will appear and you can select further items.</li>
        <li>Items with translation entered will have orange borders.</li>
        <li>ATTENTION! In the case of nested smaller elements with Identifier in larger elements with Identifier, there is a problem with selecting the smaller element. There is a way to do this:</li>
        <li>By clicking on the smaller element, you will probably select the larger one. Then move the cursor over the smaller element and click again to deselect the larger element. If you do not move the mouse too much and press the mouse again, the smaller element should be selected finally.</li>
        <li>If you believe that an item does not require translation (e.g. email address, telephone number, or texts that should not be translated), remove its Identifier. To do this, select it and press the orange button 'remove' in the section on the left</li>
        <li>Every time you identify or remove an Identifier, be sure to save the template. Failure to save can cause errors.</li>
        <li>If you want to select an item other than the one currently selected, press the orange uselect button in the section on the left or the ESC key on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>After you have translated all visible items, you need to enter translations of the images ALTs, some metadata, and items that are not visible in the view for some reason.</li>
        <li>To enter translations of the images ALTs, press the blue button 'add img translations' on the bottom bar.</li>
        <li>A list with the identified image elements will be displayed. For each of them, you must enter a translation or remove the Identifier. Ultimately, the list should be empty. Then go back to the template view.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to save the template now after removing Identifiers</li>
        <li>To enter metadata translations, press the blue button on the bottom bar "add header translations" and proceed as for image translations until the list is empty.</li>
        <li>All elements that have been identified but have not been translated so far will appear on the list after pressing the green 'untranslated' button on the bottom bar. Do the same as with metadata and images until the list is empty.</li>
        <li>SAVE TEMPLATE AGAIN!</li>
        <li>Once you have entered all the translations for a given language and removed all unnecessary Identifiers, press the green TRANSLATE TEMPLATE button on the bottom bar. You should see a translated template.</li>
        <li>You can go back to the original version of the template by pressing the same button, which is now called BACK TO ORIGIN</li>
        <li>You can disable and enable the borders view of identified / translated elements at any time. To do this, press the blue 'borders' button in the lower right corner.</li>
        <li>In fact, you can translate the template at any time, even if not all translations are entered, for example to see the progress of your work. A suitable message will be displayed.</li>
        <li>The final step is the GENERATE TEMPLATE button. Your browser should download the translated template file. Generating an incompletely translated template is not recommended.</li>
